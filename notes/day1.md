- Maths
  - Z is used to denote integers {.. -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...}
  - Q is used to denote rational number
  - R is used to denote real numbers
  - Group Theory
    - Set of elements with a binary operation(•) satisfying certain properties
      - Closure: for all the binary operations the result of it is included in the set. a•b ∈ S
      - Associativity: a•(b•c) = (a•b)•c
      - Identity element _e_ exists such that a•e = a
      - Inverse element _x_ exists in the set such that a•x = e
        - Subgroup
          - A subset of the elements of a group satisfies the group properties then that is a subset of the original group
        - Cyclic group
          - Could be a finite group
          - Applying the group operation with the generator will give all the elements of the group in a cyclic manner
          - The order of the group is the number of elements in the group
        - Finding an inverse
          - Fermat's little theorem
            - a^-1 ≡ a^(p-2) mod p
            - Eg: p=7, a=2
              - 2^(7-2) mod 7 = 4
        - Equivalence classes
          - When 2 numbers have the same remainder when divided by a number then they are in the same equivalence class
    - Fields
      - A field is a set of numbers together with 2 operations called addition and multiplication which satisfy certain properties
        - Associativity of addition and multiplication: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a _ b) _ c = a _ (b _ c)
        - Commutativity of addition and multiplication: a + b = b + a and a _ b = b _ a
        - Identity element for addition and multiplication: a + 0 = a and a \* 1 = a
        - Inverse element for addition and multiplication: a + (-a) = 0 and a \* a^-1 = 1
        - Distributivity of multiplication over addition: a*(b+c) = a*b + a\*c
      - Finite fields
        - A field with a finite set of elements: set of integers modulo a prime number
        - The order of the field is the number of elements in the field
          - For a finite field the order must be
            - a prime number (a prime field) or
            - a power of a prime number (an extension field)
      - Generator
        - Every field has a generator
        - By exponentiating the generator we can get all the elements of the field

- Cryptography
  - Hash functions
    - takes input and gives fixed size output
    - even a change in a bit of the input will give a totally different output
    - same input will give same output
    - easy to go from input to output but no way to get from output to input (non trivial)
  - Encryption
    - Symmetric encryption
      - 1 key
    - Asymmetric encryption
      - 2 keys
  - Elliptic curve - Montgomery Curves - Edwards Curves
- Polynomial
  - Schwartz Zippel Lemma
- Proving systems
  - Could be stark or snark based
  - What do we require of a proof
    - Completeness: if prover & verifier are honest the system would work
    - Soundness: a dishonest prover cannot come up with a proof which could be verified
