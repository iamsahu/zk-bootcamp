1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

What is
a) 4 + 4 = **1**
b) 3 x 5 = **1**
c) What is the inverse of 3 = **1**

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
   Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

It cannot be considered a group as:

- It is not closed
- It doesn't have an identity element
- It doesn't have an inverse element

3. What is -13 mod 5 ?
   **2**

4. Polynomials
   For the polynomial x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12
   Find a the positive root ? **2**
   What is the degree of this polynomial ? **3**
